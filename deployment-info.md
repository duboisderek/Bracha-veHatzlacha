# Deployment Configuration for Replit

## Current Issue
The deployment on Replit is not working properly because:
1. The build process takes too long and times out
2. The production configuration needs adjustment

## Solution
For Replit deployment, use the development server configuration which already works perfectly:

### In .replit file, the deployment section should be:
```
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["echo", "Build skipped"]
run = ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### Alternative: Create a simple production server
If you need a production build, create a simplified server that:
1. Serves the API routes
2. Serves the React app with Vite in production mode
3. Uses the existing session and database configuration

## Working Configuration
- Server runs on port 5000
- All API routes are functional
- Frontend is served through Vite middleware
- Database and Redis connections work properly

## Note
The temporary server (http://localhost:5000) works perfectly, so the deployment should use the same configuration.

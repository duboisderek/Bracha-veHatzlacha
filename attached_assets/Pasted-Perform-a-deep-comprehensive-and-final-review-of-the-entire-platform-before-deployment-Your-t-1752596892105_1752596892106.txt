Perform a **deep, comprehensive, and final review** of the entire platform before deployment. Your tasks:

1. **Full Frontend Review**:
   - Systematically test every page, menu, generator, modal, button, action,deposit, and play game in the UI as both user and admin. 
   - Check that all templates, file previews, navigation, and forms are fully functional.
   - Confirm that no buttons, menus, links, or UI elements are missing, broken, or inactive.

2. **Complete Backend/API Review**:
   - Test all backend routes and APIs for every page, options, action, authentication, admin actions,root admin ,user ,all users,creation users ,etc , logging, reporting, and configuration. 
   - Validate correct responses, error handling, permissions, security rules, and logging for each endpoint.
   - Ensure database integrity, file storage, and TTL auto-deletion are working.

3. **Full Workflow & Integration Testing**:
   - Simulate all user and admin workflows . 
   - Verify role-based access restrictions, audit logging, and security checks for every action.
   - Cover all edge cases, error scenarios, and validation steps.

4. **Automated and Manual Testing**:
   - Run all automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) across the platform.
   - For any failed or missing test, generate and apply fixes, then re-run until 100% pass rate.
   - If automated tests are incomplete, simulate manual tests for all major flows.

5. **Final Readiness and Robustness Checks**:
   - Verify UI/UX consistency, branding, responsiveness, and accessibility.
   - Confirm favicon is present, platform title is correct, and all public-facing texts are in English.
   - Review performance and security best practices (input validation, auth/session, sensitive data, no exposed endpoints).

6. **Correction and Continuous Loop**:
   - For every issue, bug, incomplete action, or sub-optimal UX found, automatically generate and apply fixes.
   - Repeat testing and validation in a loop until **everything is flawless, all tests pass, and the platform is truly production-ready.**

**Do NOT stop or provide a final summary until the entire platform is 100% validated and perfect for deployment.

Do not stop until the following is fully completed:

1. **Complete Multilingual Coverage**:
    - Systematically review and verify that 100% of all user-facing texts, labels, menus, buttons, forms, tooltips, notifications, errors, and workflow steps are fully translated and correctly displayed in all three languages (French, Hebrew [RTL], English).
    - For every missing, partial, or incorrect translation, automatically generate and apply the fix, then re-verify all three languages.
    - Repeat this process in a continuous loop until multilingual coverage is truly 100% everywhere in the application, with perfect RTL/LTR formatting and no regressions.

2. **When — and only when — full translation coverage is achieved and verified in all languages, continue with these next steps:**

    a. **Security & Compliance Audit**:
        - Review and test authentication, session management, access rights, and input validation for all roles and actions.
        - Identify and fix any vulnerability or compliance risk.
    
    b. **Performance & UX Optimization**:
        - Test loading speed, resource usage, and UI responsiveness.
        - Identify any UX friction points and make recommendations or apply improvements.

    c. **Documentation & User Guide**:
        - Generate complete, clear documentation and quickstart guides for users and admins, including instructions for language switching and troubleshooting translations.

    d. **Monitoring, Logging, and Backups**:
        - Review and enhance monitoring, log export, health checks, and backup systems to ensure long-term reliability and data safety.

    e. **Automated End-to-End Tests**:
        - Build and integrate automated E2E tests that cover all languages and critical workflows, to guarantee that everything remains perfect after updates or deployments.

For each phase, do NOT ask for feedback or stop for confirmation.  
Only report completion when 100% of texts are translated and all post-production points above are fully implemented and verified.
